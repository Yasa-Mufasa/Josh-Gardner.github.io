# Name

K-Means Graph

# Language

Python

# Description

K-Means Graph will generate a graph displaying the different number of clusters within a 2-dimensional set of data. The program will take 2 columns from a data frame and run k-means clustering on the input data. The number of clusters defaults to 4 but can be changed by the user. The different clusters are then graphed with the different clusters denoted by different colors. The colors can be selected by the user or left to the default setting.

K-Means Graph accepts a data frame, column names of the two variables in a list, the number of desired clusters, and the color theme.

# Usage

Examples will be provided as the project is developed.

# Project Status

This project is still in the planning phase and will enter development Q4 of 2019.
