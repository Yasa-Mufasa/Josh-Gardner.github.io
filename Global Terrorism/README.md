# Description

Understanding terrorisme can help to drive policies and practices to help decrease the number of terroristic acts that are perpetrated throughout the world. Decreasing the amount of terrorism around the world will help to keep everyone safe and will hopefully raise the standard of living for everyone.

This project will be examining datasets examining terrorism. I will be looking to answer the following questions:

1. How does a region's instability influence the rates of terrorism?
2. Does strengthening a region's stability lower the terrorism rate of that region?
3. How can the different acts of terror be grouped together? Can anything be inferred by how the terroristic acts are grouped?
4. Does one region's terrorism cluster influence another region's cluster? Specifically, how does the terrorism cluster influence non-adjacent terrorism rates?
